 * Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree
 *
 * Given a binary tree, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the tree.

 According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes v and w as the lowest node in T that has both v and w as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”

 For example, the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of nodes 5 and 1 is 3. Another example is LCA of nodes 5 and 4 is 5, since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.
